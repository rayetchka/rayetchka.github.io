# Techniques

## Objectives

The techniques detailed bellow are based on
- Ψ shaped adhesive tape construct,
- tape types compatible with skin contact,  
  avoided direct adhesive contact if possible,
- testes positionned up in inguinal canal, scrotum partially fold.

The back part of the construct can be opened from back to front
and repositionned several times (in toilet context for example).

## Precautions

- Prepare skin dry and clean before (shower/bath).
- Prefer hair-clipper/beard-trimmer to shaving.
- In order to avoid skin infection, the area should be kept
  clean and need regular care and breaks.
- Prefer cleaning from front to bottom due to close proximity
  between urethra and rectum.
- Warming testes in inguinal canal may or may not be a fully
  efficient contraceptive technique (spermatogenesis require
  3~5 degree below body temperature).
