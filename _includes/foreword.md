# About *“passing”* and *cis-normativity*

## *“Passing”*
refers to non conforming person's ability to be correctly perceived
as the right gender and beyond that, to be perceived as cisgender.  

## *“Passing privilege”*
People perceived as cisgender (or to some extends seemingly conforming
to cis‑normative gender sterotypes) experience significantly less harassment
than thoose who do not (*i.e.* visibly not cisgender).

## Cis‑normalization
People who *“pass”* get more media attention because it **normalize** people.  
One of the problems is that this kind of focus on people with tremendous
amount of *passing privilege* __erases the existence of__ thoose who do not.
Some *pass* better than others, not every one can afford (or want) to *pass*.

Moreover, the standards are defined by cis‑people in ways designed
to specificaly erase non‑conforming people.
The pressure to meet inaccessible social beauty standards
not only impact how the rest of the world sees non‑conforming people,
but also how thoose see themselves when they look in the mirror.

## So, why looking to *“pass”* if it's something __inherently evil__ ? 👿

### → Reducing harassment
As said before, people get more and more backdraft
as they withdraw cisgender expectations.  
The converse statement is that *“passing”* may be seen to some exends
as *a survival issue*.

### → Manufactured product's cis‑centric designs
Cisgender people design their own stuffs following only their own expectations,
and specifically thoose related to body shapes.  
Some can experience more or less *incomfort* and/or difficulties
using products not designed taking their specific needs in account.

### → Internalized cis‑normativity
The more cis is the standard, the more cis‑standards overwhelms anything else,
including our vision ourselves.  
Surrounded by omnipresence of cisnorms, we see ourself through cis-glasses
whatever beiing cis or not.  
*“Passing”* falsely increase *self-esteem*.
